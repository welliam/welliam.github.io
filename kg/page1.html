        You are a coalescence of soul, spirit, and shadow separated
        from <a id="Your old body" href="#">the body</a> of a powerful
        magus who has just died. The other components of your ethereal
        self: your name and heart, have been lost to
        oblivion. However, your willpower is stronger than most. As a
        disembodied union of three, you have in you the ability to
        consume, merge with, and supplant the spirit, shadow, and soul
        respectively of one of the six living entities who are in the
        room your body died in, thereby permanently possessing the
        subject.
      </p><p>
        Your aforementioned death has caused a scene, which is now
        frozen in time while you choose your next body.
        <a id="Longinus" href="#">One person</a>, bloody weapon in
        hand, appears to have been the cause of death. Nearby is
        <a id="Joan" href="#">someone else</a>, about to draw a
        weapon. At a table are two people staring, the <a id="Hagar"
        href="#">older of them</a> rising [<a id="Lazarus"
        href="#">younger</a>]. By another table is <a id="Salome"
        href="#">another person</a>, moving toward the conflict. And
        lastly, in the back, <a id="Babalon" href="#">someone</a> sits
        at a table and watches thoughtfully.
      </p><p>
        Your actions are temporarily limited to inspect and possess.  What
        will you do?
