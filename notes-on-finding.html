  <h3>Notes on Finding Modes of Limited Transposition</h3>
  <p>
    The concept of a mode of limited transposition (MOLT) is usually defined in two ways; a scale which has a limited number of transpositions before the scales intervals repeat itself, or a scale which has less modes than notes in the scale. In any case these two explanations describe the same set of scales. Althoguh Messiaen is the inventor of this concept, he also defines MOLTs as not being truncation of other MOLTs, and goes further in listing the possible MOLTs. However, only two of his MOLTs are not truncations of other MOLTs, MOLTs number 3 and 7. Luckily, Messiaen did not miss any other "true" MOLTs in this sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding MOLTs is somewhat simple. First, we take the prime factors of 12, because 12 is the number of tones in our scale. These prime factors are 2 and 3. We then divide up our scale by those intervals and get the tritone (0 6) and the augmented chord (0 4 8). We call these prime symmetrical scales (PSSes) because they have a prime number of notes and have even intervals.
    Any interpolation* of either of these PSSes is a MOLT. If we continue to interpolate both of these scales we will find every MOLT; that is to say, there are no MOLTs which cannot be discovered through interpolation of these notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interpolation is the process of deriving a new scale from an old one. We start with a scale, e.g. (0 4 8) (or, in C, C E Ab), and add a note either below or above the tritone. So, an interpolation might be (0 1 4 5 8 9); we might call this an interpolation of 1 semitone. An interpolation of 1 whole tone would be (0 2 4 6 8 10); this is the whole tone scale. We can interpolate a scale more than once. However, when we interpolate the second time, we do not also interpolate with the already interpolated notes. For example, if we were to interpolate the tritone, (0 6), twice, we would first interpolate it by the first interval (e.g., a semitone, the result being (0 1 6 7), and the by the second (e.g., a minor third, the final result being the octatonic scale (0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10)).
  </p>
  <p>
    A disadvantage of using this method is that there will be duplicate scales derived from both prime factors. For example, we can find the whole tone scale by interpolating the augmented chord once by a whole tone, or by interpolating the tritone twice by first a whole tone and second by a major third. MOLTs which can be found by either PSS have a number of notes which is divisible by both prime factors of 12.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this is sufficient for finding MOLTs in our 12 tone scale, the process works equally well for all well tempered tone scales. For example, finding the MOLTs of the 10 tone scale involves first prime factorizing 10 (yielding 2 and 5, which in turn yield the scales (0 5), the tritone, and (0 2 4 6 8), a scale which involves tones not expressible in our 12 tone scale). After this, we interpolate until we find all the scales (<a href="file:///Users/well/prog/js/welliam.github.io/scales/molts010.txt">there are 17 in all</a>, if we include the PSSes and the "chromatic" 10 tone scale). Because both 12 and 10 have 2 as a prime factor, the scales share a PSS, the tritone.
  </p>
  <p>
    PSSes are interesting in themselves. The 3 tone scale, for example, is merely the 3 PSS in the 12 tone scale, i.e. the augmented chord. Also, 6 tone scale is a subset of the 12 tone scale. In fact, the 6 tone scale is merely the whole tone scale. Because of this, we can write scales in the 6 tone scale in terms of notes from the 12 tone scale. We can thus consider the 6 tone well tempered scale as a "sub-system" of our 12 tone scale.
  </p>

    Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "pure" MOLTs-- that is, the MOLTs which are not truncations of other MOLTs-- are the chromatic scales with a single PSS removed. One might also thing of this as "uninterpolating" a PSS. For example, Messiaen's 7th MOLT is the chromatic scale with a tritone removed, and his 3rd is the chromatic scale with an augmented chord removed.
