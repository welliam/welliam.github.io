        <h1>The G.E. reagent: Mostly acetic acid or mostly glycerol?</h1>
        <i>24 July 2023</i>
        <p>
            Recently I've been trying microcrystallization, a
            technique for identifying lichen chemicals, where extracts
            of lichen chemicals are crystallized using various
            reagents. Once applied, the crystals are allowed to
            form (think a "crystal growing kit" from your childhood,
            but much smaller!) and then are viewed under high powered
            microscope (usually 100-400x).

                    = glycerol/ethanol/water by volume). The pretty
                    colors come from polarized light filters placed
                    perpendicular to each other before and after the
                    sample ("cross polarization"); the only light that
                    is visible in this configuration is that which has
                    been diffracted by the crystals.

        <h2>3:1 or 1:3?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most common reagents is G.E., which is made up
            of glycerol (a.k.a. glycerin) and glacial acetic acid.
            When reading about the G.E. reagent I noticed a confusing
            discrepancy; some sources gave it as 3:1 glycerol:acetic
            acid, and some as 3:1 acetic acid:glycerol. After some
            searching, the earliest reference to the G.E. reagent I
            could find was in a paper by Yasuhiko Asahina, who
            pioneered the technique in general, in 1936
            (<i>Mikrochemischer Nachweis der Flechtenstoffe
            II</i>). This paper says G.E. is <b>3:1 acetic
            acid:glycerol</b>, which, as far as I can tell, is the
            correct formula, and the one lichenologists used.
        </formula>
        <p>
            I believe the 1996 book <i>Identification of Lichen
            Substances</i> by Siegfried Huneck and Isao Yoshimura to
            be the earliest example of this error. Another book with
            the error, from 2001,
            <i>Microchemical Methods for the Identification of
            Lichens</i> by A. Orange, P.W. James and F.J. White, cites
            Huneck. It feels like an easy mistake to make; G.E. is
            intuitively mostly the G (glycerol), not the E ("ethanoic
            acid", the systematic name for acetic acid).
        </p>
        <p>
            Tragically, Huneck's book has a large number of photos of
            microcrystallization, most of which using G.E. The formula
            for G.E. is only given once in the book, so it's unclear
            whether they followed it when taking the photos, or if it
            was just a typo.
        </p>
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Microcrystallization as a technique has long since fallen
            out of favor due to thin layer chromatography, another
            analytical technique capable of identifying small amounts
            of substances and requiring less subjective interpretation
            of results. However, unlike thin layer chromatography,
            microcrystallization is easy to do, requires less hands on
            time, and doesn't require the use of dangerous chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these reasons, I believe microcrystallization could
            have a place for separating species which differ only in
            chemistry. However, without a high quality and reliable
            source of images to compare with, microcrystallization
            might fall out of favor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the error seems limited to these books, they are
            both frequently referenced (Google Scholar says 1,277
            citations of Huneck and 2,262 citations for Orange). It's
            troubling to think that readers may reach for one of these
            books when preparing G.E., with confusing results when
            their crystals don't form as expected, or, if they do
            catch the error, that they might be discouraged by the
            conflicting information. Getting to the bottom of the
            issue for me required tracking down the Asahina article,
            which is in German and from 1936.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to help this situation by providing high quality
            information about microcrystallization. In addition to an
            free, online online guide, I want to provide high quality
            microcrystallization photos. Although Huneck is immensely
            valuable, the photos often lack the lichen source, as well
            as when the photos were taken relative to applying the
            reagent (some crystals form very slowly, some very
            quickly). A way of querying photos of microcrystallization
            results by taxa, reagent, extraction method, etc. would do
            a lot for the usefulness of the technique.
