  <h3>Notes for Reading MOLT Lists</h3>
  <p>
    Because many of the scales we write about cannot be expressed in
    the 12 tone scale, we are forced to resort to numbered scales for
    many of the MOLT lists. When we can represent the scales as notes
    of the 12 tone scale, we do so in C, and we also give the numeric
    representation common to all lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to translating the numeric scales to the 12 tone
    scale, we also represent the 8 tone and 24 tone scales in terms of
    quarter tone notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently the algorithm for finding MOLTs is too slow for many
    scales above the 24 tone scale. The exception to this is scales
    which are equal to squares of prime numbers. These scales are
    exceptional because they only have one unique prime factor, which
    means only one PSS; this limits the number of MOLTs, which lets
    the algorithm runs fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have not found a good way to find the number of MOLTs for
    arbitrary tone scales (I'm sure this is trivial for someone who's
    better at math than I am); however, it seems that for prime
    squared-tone scales, the number of MOLTs is equal to 2 to the
    power of its prime factor minus one. For example, the 49 tone
    scale (7<sup>2</sup>) is equal to 2<sup>7-1</sup>, 64. As a
    result, I have found that my algorithm runs in a tolerable amount
    of time for all prime-squared tone scales up to 169
    (13<sup>2</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding the number of symmetrical scales for a given equal
    tempered scale is easy. Given <i>n</i> tones, there are
    2<sup>&lceil;(<i>n</i>/2)&rceil;</sup> scales. For example, for the
    9 tone scale, there are 2<sup>5</sup> symmetrical scales
    (&lceil;(9/2)&rceil; = 5). Unfortunately, this means finding
    all the symmetical scale for numbers much larger than 24 becomes
    increasingly ridiculous (and impossible in a reasonable amount of
    memory). For example, the 169-tone scale would have
    2<sup>85</sup> (38,685,626,227,668,100,000,000,000) symmetrical scales.
