  <h3>Notes for Reading MOLT Lists</h3>
  <p>
    Because many of the scales listed cannot be expressed in the 12
    tone scale, the lists numbers the scales from 0 to <i>n</i>-1
    for <i>n</i>-equal tempered scales. When it is possible to
    represent the scales as notes of the 12 tone scale, the lists
    start with C. When it is possible to translate the scale to the 24
    scale this is done, again starting with C.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently the algorithm for finding MOLTs is too slow for many
    scales above the 24 tone scale. The exception to this is scales
    which are equal to squares of prime numbers. These scales are
    exceptional because they only have one unique prime factor, which
    means only one PSS; this limits the number of MOLTs, which lets
    the algorithm runs fast. Therefore, the list includes
    prime-squared-equal tempered scales for primes up to 13.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have not found a good way to find the number of MOLTs for
    arbitrary tone scales (I'm sure this is trivial for someone who's
    better at math than I am); however, it seems that for prime
    squared-tone scales, the number of MOLTs is equal to 2 to the
    power of its prime factor minus one. For example, the 49 tone
    scale (7<sup>2</sup>) is equal to 2<sup>7-1</sup>, 64. As a
    result, I have found that my algorithm runs in a tolerable amount
    of time for all prime-squared tone scales up to 169
    (13<sup>2</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>
    For <i>n</i> tones, there are
    2<sup>&lceil;(<i>n</i>/2)&rceil;</sup> symmetrical scales. For
    example, for the 9 tone scale, there are 2<sup>5</sup> symmetrical
    scales. Unfortunately, this means finding all the symmetical scale
    for numbers much larger than 24 becomes increasingly ridiculous
    (and impossible in a reasonable amount of memory). The 169-tone
    scale, only having 4096 MOLTs, would have 2<sup>85</sup>
    (38,685,626,227,668,133,590,597,632) symmetrical
    scales. Therefore, for equal tempered scales higher than 25 the
    corresponding symmetrical scales are not listed.
