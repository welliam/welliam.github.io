  <h3>Notes on Finding Modes of Limited Transposition</h3>
  <p>
    The concept of a mode of limited transposition (MOLT) is usually defined in two ways; a scale with a limited number of transpositions before the scale's notes repeat themselves, or a scale which has less modes than notes in the scale. These two explanations describe the same set of scales. Messiaen was the inventor of the concept, and his definition also did not allow MOLTs which were truncations of other MOLTs. Although he also listed all the possible MOLTs, his list contradicted this rule; only two MOLTs (both of which were included in his list&ndash; his 3rd and 7th MOLTs) are not truncations of other MOLTs. For the sake of simplicity, we consider truncations to be MOLTs too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding MOLTs is somewhat simple. First, we take the prime factors of 12, because 12 is the number of tones in our scale. These prime factors are 2 and 3. We then divide up our scale by those intervals and get the tritone (<b>0 6</b>) and the augmented chord (<b>0 4 8</b>). We call these prime symmetrical scales (PSSes) because they have a prime number of notes and have even intervals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any interpolation of either of these PSSes is a MOLT. If we continue to interpolate both of these scales we will find every MOLT; that is to say, there are no MOLTs which cannot be discovered through interpolation of these notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interpolation is a process for deriving new scales from another, smaller scale. To interpolate, start with a scale, e.g. (<b>0 4 8</b>), and add a note either below or above each note. An interpolation might be (<b>0</b> 1 <b>4</b> 5 <b>8</b> 9) (bolded notes are those which are part of the original scale); we might call this an interpolation of one semitone. An interpolation of one whole tone would be (<b>0</b> 2 <b>4</b> 6 <b>8</b> 10); this is the whole tone scale. We can interpolate a scale more than once. However, when we interpolate the second time, we do not interpolate with the already interpolated notes. For example, if we were to interpolate the tritone, (<b>0</b> <b>6</b>), twice, we would first interpolate it by the first interval (e.g., a semitone, the result being (<b>0</b> 1 <b>6</b> 7), and then by the second (e.g., a minor third, the final result being (<b>0</b> 1 3 <b>6</b> 7 9)).
  </p>
  <p>
    A disadvantage of using this method is that there will be duplicate scales derived from both prime factors. For example, we can find the whole tone scale by interpolating the augmented chord once by a whole tone, or by interpolating the tritone twice by a whole tone and a major third. MOLTs which can be found by either PSS have a number of notes which is divisible by both prime factors of 12.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this explanation is sufficient for finding MOLTs in our 12 tone scale, the process works equally well for all equal tempered scales. For example, finding the MOLTs of the 10 tone scale involves first prime factorizing 10 (yielding 2 and 5, which in turn yield the PSSes (<b>0 5</b>), the tritone, and (<b>0 2 4 6 8</b>), a scale which involves intervals not in our 12 tone scale). After this, we interpolate until we find all the scales (<a href="molts/molts010.txt">there are 17 in all</a>, if we include the PSSes and the "chromatic" 10 tone scale). Because both 12 and 10 have 2 as a prime factor, the scales share a PSS, the tritone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationship between PSSes and equal tempered scales is also interesting. The 3 tone scale, for example, is merely the 3 PSS in the 12 tone scale, i.e. the augmented chord. Similarly, the 6 tone scale is a subset of the 12 tone scale. In fact, the 6 tone system is simply the whole tone scale. Because of this, we can write 6 tone scales in terms of notes from the 12 tone scale. Thus, the 6 tone equal tempered scale is a "sub-system" of our 12 tone scale. Naturally, all MOLTs of the 6 tone scale remain MOLTs in the 12 tone scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, it is worth mentioning that the "pure" MOLTs&ndash; that is, the MOLTs which are not truncations of other MOLTs&ndash; are the chromatic scales with a single PSS removed. One might also think of this as "uninterpolating" a PSS. For example, Messiaen's 7th MOLT is the chromatic scale with a tritone removed, and his 3rd is the chromatic scale with an augmented chord removed.
