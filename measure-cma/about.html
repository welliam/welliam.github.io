      <h1>About CMA Measurement Tool</h1>
      <p>
        A useful characteristic for identifying Usnea species is the relative
        size of the cortex, medulla, and axis when viewed in cross section. This
        is a tool for quickly making CMA measurements and downloading annotated
        images.

      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <p>
        To make a CMA measurement, click the image to make a mark. Once six
        marks have been made, the CMA will be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they can be done in any order, making two marks that span the
        diameter of the measurement first allows for a more accurate
        measurement. Take care to make sure this measurement is exactly
        perpendicular to the branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a mistake is made while adding measurements, the undo (&#x21B6;) and
        redo (&#x21B7;) buttons can be used (ctrl-z also works!). To clear
        measurements and start over, click the "Clear measurements" button. To
        clear the image and upload another, click the "New" button.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download your annotated image at this point by clicking the
        "Download" button. The Label field annotates what the photo is of, and
        the "Include CMA" option lets you toggle adding the CMA measurement on
        the image. To leave out the label entirely, clear the Label field.

      <h2>Making the longitudinal cut</h2>
      This can be a little tricky. Here's a rough illustration of how
      I take CMA measurements:
