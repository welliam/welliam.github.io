      <h1>How to identify <em>Usnea</em></h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Generally my process for identifying <em>Usnea</em> in my area (the
          Pacific Northwest) is to fill out the following information:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Growth form</td>
              <td><em>Pendulous / tufted</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Branch shape</td>
              <td><em>Cylindrical / cigar-shaped</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Other branch features</td>
              <td>
                <em>
                  None / branch ends sinuose / branches with ridges and valleys
                </em>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Annular cracks</td>
              <td><em>Many / some / none</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Reproductive structures</td>
              <td>
                <em>
                  Isidia only / isidia in young/all soralia / soralia lacking
                  isidia / none or apotheciate

                <em>
                  Soralia small / soralia large, >1/2 branch diameter / cortex
                  recurving around soralia / soralia deep with axis visible
                </em>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

          <h3>Observing</h3>
          There is a large amount of variance withing <em>Usnea</em>, and it can
          be easy to overlook telltale signs of species. I find the above
          information is best done under a dissecting microscope at around 40x
          magnification. It's best to take a long time here and not to draw
          conclusions too quickly; for example, rather than noting the first
          soralia you see, it's better to look at many and note what a normal
          soralia appears, as well as note differences between young and old
          soralia.
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Spot tests</h3>
          As many sources note, spot tests are unreliable and usually only
          "corroborate" an existing identification. UV can be tricky as well, as
          some species are only weakly UV+. I take strong, clear reactions as
          being conclusive and negative reactions as being unconclusive.

          <h3>How to make CMA measurements</h3>
          <p>
            Sources generally recommend making cross-sections on thick branches,
            with Philippe Clerc taking them on the "thickest part of the
            thickest branch" or McCune and Geiser recommending using a "main but
            not basal" branch.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can sometimes be useful to gently wet the thallus if it's dry,
            but usually I can make cuts equally easily on wet and dessicated
            thalli.
          </p>
          <p>
            I identify a good relatively exposed spot under a stereo microscope
            at ~15x magnification. I then rotate the thallus so it's at a
            comfortable angle to cut (for me this is usually at a 45&deg; angle,
            with my hand securing the thallus to the bottom left). I then hold
            down the thallus with my non-dominant hand and focus using the
            scope, then gently move away other fibrils using forceps. I make the
            cut directly on the thallus, gently sawing with my right hand. It's
            important that the cut runs directly down the middle of the branch.
            If I notice that I haven't cut deeply enough (the axis not being
            visible or being obscured
            <em>in front</em> by the medulla is a sign of this), I'll make
            another cut until it's more or less correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making the cut, I shine my UV lamp on it and note if it
            fluoresces or not, and how strongly. I then align the thallus so
            it's horizontal, and zoom in as closely as possible to take a photo
            through the microscope oculars using my phone. I crop this image on
            my phone so the branch is in the lower 2/3rds of the frame with some
            space above for the label, then upload to the CMA measurement tool
            and make the measurement there. I usually fill in the label field
            just with my herbarium number and download the image at this point.
