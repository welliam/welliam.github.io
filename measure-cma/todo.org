* TODO bug: fix help page screenshots/description
"reset" -> new button and others
* TODO improvement: indicate progress somehow
* TODO improvement: mark breakdown as closed when dots are cleared or ctrl-z
* TODO bug: fix fuzzy "click to upload photo" (is it being upscaled? why)
* TODO bug: fix dot "sticking" when placing 6 dots and undoing all
* TODO refactor: fix naming: draw vs render
* TODO refactor: abstract canvas out
* TODO refactor: clean up how DOM is updated
- abstract out rendering and pass into state function so state functio nis clean
- add pure rendering layer and separate from DOM updating layer
- the state function could take lens/render function pairs which are deep compared with previous states to determine whether to render
* TODO refactor: test suite
* TODO refactor: typescript
* TODO refactor: dots state?
- invariant: dots should always be on a line
- instead we could model the state in a way that makes it impossible
  for that not to be the case
- for example, model with start and end dot, and have the inner dots be distances along that line
  - this would simplify CMA calculation, but make display logic more complicated
  - function that "recovers" dots from this wouldn't be difficult though
* DONE bug: fix jostling when finishing measurement (particularly annoying on mobile)
* DONE bug: visual bugs on button control layer
- undo/redo and text buttons are different sizes
- buttons are also not vertically aligned
- solution 1: make emoji buttons smaller
- solution 2: give other buttons default height
- fixed this using line-height
* DONE bug: flat line doesn't show bar line all the way through
dots init state that breaks:
[
    {
      "x": 388.9922071135593,
      "y": 839.7733083941023
    },
    {
      "x": 480.2862965381701,
      "y": 839.7733083941023
    },
    {
      "x": 448.53183065134897,
      "y": 839.7733083941023
    },
    {
      "x": 424.71598123623306,
      "y": 839.7733083941023
    }
  ]
* DONE bug: fix double tap case
- double tap a measurement and the page breaks
- this is a valid use case (e.g. u. longissima has no cortex)
- disabled this instead
* DONE note rounding logic in breakdown
* DONE fix control problem
- label is too long on mobile but the length is desirable on desktop
  - media labels?
  - horizontal scrollbar shows up
* DONE fix measurement line rendering
- perpendicular lines should stay put, those are "correct"
- bridge line should align based of 1/2 of line width
* DONE idea for image size flexibility
- right now max size is hardcoded, would be nice if this were configurable or something
- problem is that redrawing image by resizing is annoying
- could allow user to resize canvas, then center image
** resolved:
- keep image size the same, use css to rerender canvas
* DONE mobile enhancements
fix dot on single click
* DONE hotkeys
- undo
- redo
- make sure label text doesn't interfere
- document on "what is this?" modal
* DONE how to modal
- include contact info
- mention website doesn't save anything-- data stays on your computer
- how to image
- link or reference to CMA/Usnea resource
* DONE breakdown of CMA calculation in pixels
|               |   C |   M |   A |
|               |   1 |   3 |   3 |
|               |   3 |   3 |     |
|---------------+-----+-----+-----|
| average       |   2 |   3 |   3 |
| % of diameter | 15% | 23% | 23% |

diameter = 13
* DONE bug: one dot state is weird
- removed mobile thing ;w;
* DONE fix filename of download
- no label= "CMA [datetime].png"
- otherwise "CMA [label].png"
* DONE bug: when guide line is completely vertical, perp lines are wrong
* DONE handle infinity case
* DONE fix cma calc
* DONE perpendicular brackets on diameter line
- don't do dot line until two dots exist
* DONE media type on file uploader for images
* DONE show diameter
* WONTDO dot "clicking" logic
- find closest dot
- give up if farther than treshold
- highlight dot if within range of pointer
* WONTDO move mode
- use dot clicking logic
* WONTDO delete mode
- use dot clicking logic
- dont need
* DONE let user write on image
- auto label cma?
- or just a "optional label/cma" option
* DONE make design not bad
- implementation: move styles out of js, into css, add classes instead
* DONE undo
* WONTDO realign tool
- rotate by 90 deg is easy, others is harder
- maybe shouldn't do
* WONTDO crop tool
- maybe shouldn't do
