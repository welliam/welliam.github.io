* DONE handle infinity case
* DONE fix cma calc
* DONE perpendicular brackets on diameter line
- don't do dot line until two dots exist
* DONE media type on file uploader for images
* TODO show diameter
* TODO dot "clicking" logic
- find closest dot
- give up if farther than treshold
- highlight dot if within range of pointer
* TODO move mode
- use dot clicking logic
* TODO delete mode
- use dot clicking logic
* TODO let user write on image
- auto label cma?
- or just a "optional label/cma" option
* TODO make design not bad
- implementation: move styles out of js, into css, add classes instead
* TODO dots state refactor?
- invariant: dots should always be on a line
- instead we could model the state in a way that makes it impossible
  for that not to be the case
- for example, model with start and end dot, and have the inner dots be distances along that line
  - this would simplify CMA calculation, but make display logic more complicated
  - function that "recovers" dots from this wouldn't be difficult though
* TODO idea for image size flexibility
- right now max size is hardcoded, would be nice if this were configurable or something
- problem is that redrawing image by resizing is annoying
- could allow user to resize canvas, then center image
* TODO realign tool
- rotate by 90 deg is easy, others is harder
- maybe shouldn't do
* TODO crop tool
- maybe shouldn't do
* TODO test suite and/or typescript
